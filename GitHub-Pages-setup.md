Here's how to deploy to GitHub Pages:

Step 1: Connect to GitHub
In Lovable: Click the GitHub button in the top-right corner
Authorize the Lovable GitHub App
Create Repository - this will push your current code to a new GitHub repo

Step 2: Enable GitHub Pages
Go to your new GitHub repository
Click Settings tab
Scroll to Pages section
Under Source, select GitHub Actions
Choose the Static HTML workflow or create a custom one

Step 3: Configure Build for GitHub Pages
Your app needs a small build configuration to work properly with GitHub Pages. The main thing is ensuring the build output goes to the right place and paths are correct.

Step 4: Set Up Custom Domain (Optional)
In GitHub repo → Settings → Pages
Add your custom domain name
In your domain DNS settings, add a CNAME record pointing to yourusername.github.io

Step 5: Auto-deployment
Once set up, every time you make changes in Lovable (or push to GitHub), your site will automatically rebuild and deploy!

Benefits of this setup:
✅ Free hosting
✅ Automatic deployments
✅ Custom domain support
✅ No server maintenance
✅ Global CDN (fast worldwide)
✅ HTTPS included
